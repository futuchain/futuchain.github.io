## Futuchain whitepaper & roadmap (work in progress - contracts not out yet, don't fall for scams please)

Establishing a new level of web governance by entering into international agreements with projects of high value for the rebirth of an IOT 3.0 

## The DAO

FUTUCHAIN Decentralize collaborations between individuals and companies, simplifying their connection through partnership services and facilitations for token governance holders (FUTU)

## Problem

Solve the lack of decentralized connections between individuals and companies, give greater possibility to connect freely and anonymously in any place and time to companies and individuals open to collaborations and partnerships. 


## Solution

Create a network of contacts between different sectors able to interact autonomously in the community and raise funds in a decentralized way thanks to the technology of the ERC-20 futuchain contract $FUTU. Equity token holders will be able to actively participate in the dao benefiting from all the facilities and partnerships, choosing whether to remain anonymous thanks to the security of the DeFi. Creators will be able to get in direct contact with investors by taking advantage of the IC internet conjoiner protocol, a platform that will list several projects that can be published through the purchase of FUTU tokens, thus becoming a token governance holder having the opportunity to take advantage of partnership and funding services.

### FutuDAO (FUTU) 
(70000 tokens on ETHEREUM network, airdrop only for active users of the DAO)
//contract not out yet, do not fall for scams we will announce this later 



To join Futuchain DAO you must be a rICO (RICO) holder and ask a member to submit a request for you. 
You then receive Ultrafund (FUTUXL) amount that matches your rICO (RICO) holding aka initial investment 
You can now vote and make proposals for the UltraDAO (from futuchain)

Community time. 
After a long (maybe not so long) period of building and burning the roadmap steps, screenshot will happen and an airdrop of FutuDAO (FUTU) tokens will occur for all rICO (RICO) holders.

FutuDAO (FUTU) token is a liqudity token, you can buy, sell, trade, pay. It also gives you the chance to access to the FutuDAO (futudao.aragonid.eth
Connected to Polygon) through a request in the UltraDAO (you can always request but only FutuDAO (FUTU) token grants you chance to access the FutuDAO. 
(Council will counter vote you 99% of times if FutuDAO token does not figure in your wallet)

Once accepted, you will finally receive 1 FutuToken (FUTU) and be able to join votes in a reputationless DAO (FutuDAO) where every vote counts the same and everyone's proposals are equally important.


```markdown
//Summary:

BUY RICO 
-> HOLD -> 
-> ASK FOR A REQUEST TO JOIN ULTRADAO ->
MAKE AND JOIN VOTES ON ULTRADAO 

Community time: We drop nfts, community projects, continue with marketing, listen and develop your ideas, airdrops and so on, you get it, fun stuff happening in this sector (We dont want to ruin it, no rush)

STILL HODLING RICO? -> YOU GET AN AIRDROP OF FUTUDAO (FUTU) TOKENS ->
->REQUEST IN ULTRADAO FOR AN EARLY ACCESS IN FUTUDAO ->
->GET ONE FUTUTOKEN (FUTU) GOVERNANCE TOKEN WHEN ACCEPTED

Welcome to the final DAO, FutuDAO//
```

## IC Pools

1 - You swap ETH for FutuDAO (FUTU), making so you are investing in futuchain (you can skip this part if you are already a FutuDAO FUTU holder)

2 - We deeply search for new awesome projects and partnerships

3 - We proceed to show the most valuable ones to the community

4 - Investors can now choose among the projects and vote for the best ones. We will make pools available based on the projects score after the vote is done. 

5 - You can now stake your FutuDAO (FUTU) chosen pair and earn LP rewards while supporting the project. (Also remember that if you change your mind you can always claim back your committed ETH in every moment, just swap your tokens for ETH on your favourite DEX).

6 - Now that your FutuDAO (FUTU) is sitting in your preferred pair pool with no locking period, you can claim your liquidity provider rewards overtime, you can choose to compound all in the same pool or hold the tokens reward in to your wallet, you can claim more governance presence swapping ETH for FutuDAO (FUTU) on your favourite DEX and stake those in more project active pools or just hold in your wallet for the monthly airdrops. Refreshing air. 

7 - The projects have now access to more liquidity to improve development and advertise, this will lead to more visibility to bring more investors in and make them aware of the complete ecosystem. This will also affect your rewards and have a strong impact on the APR.

8 - Also every listed project will probably be an holder of the equity token FutuDAO (FUTU). 
This is for both creators and investors: The more FutuDAO (FUTU) you stake (or is staked) in your pool of choice, the more score the project will earn. 

## Partnership

Each partner that will become an equity token holder will offer and also receive facilities from the other major holders who are members of the community.
